# Fertility_Rate_ML_Project
Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen to the 2021 World Sustainability Symposium. My name is Kenneth Sikes and I appreciate you taking the time to come to our panel discussion regarding the current world population the factors affecting the current decline in population. 

If you will bear with me for a moment to consider world history, I invite you to think about the world’s greatest empires. The Roman, Persian, British etc.. 

When we think about these empires, our first thoughts generally turn to the leaders that ruled them and great conquests fought. When you really dig into why these wars were fought and why empires were built - it was for food. The countries needed land to farm, and they needed bodies to work the land. What they needed to sustain power was an ever increasing population. It is a domino effect as population increases, the need for more land to feed the population increases 

This may be a bit of a long way to get around to the point but this is what has driven our research at PGCK.Inc. Recent studies have confirmed that our world population is actually on a decline. Most people would react “Ken you’re crazy - there are 7 billion people on the planet - how could our population be declining!?”

Exactly - how can our population be declining? Why is our population declining? And finally what can we do about it?

My colleagues and I have been working tirelessly for the last 11 days to find out. Our discussion today is centered around the factors that are contributing one way or another to the total world population. Our aim has not been to take the first of many steps in the direction to understand the issue, and hopefully take corrective actions. To sum it up - if the world population is in fact in decline, then what is effecting that decline and what can we do about it?
